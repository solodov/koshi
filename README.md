# Koshi

**Koshi** gives your [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) projects a powerful lift with AI-assisted commit messages, interactive refinement, and a streamlined GitHub Pull Request workflow â€” all from your terminal.

---

## Features

- **AI-powered commit descriptions**
  Generate and iteratively refine commit messages for your JJ commits using [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat). Accept or refine suggestions interactively based on your diffs.
- **Tight GitHub integration**
  Effortlessly create and update GitHub PRs from your JJ commits with [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/).
- **Interactive terminal UI**
  Uses [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) for beautiful, user-friendly command-line interactions and formatting.
- **Smart reviewer management**
  Select reviewers for PRs interactively; merges suggestions from your config and any previous PR reviewers.

## Usage

### Generate/Refine Commit Message with AI

```sh
koshi ai-desc [--role "<ROLE>"] [--ticket "<TICKET_ID>"] [--commit] [--pull_request]
```

- `--role <ROLE>`: Override the configured AI assistant's role.
- `--ticket <TICKET_ID>`: Reference a ticket or issue ID in the commit message.
- `--commit`: After confirming the description, automatically create a new commit.
- `--pull_request`: Automatically open or update a GitHub pull request.

If no `--role` is specified, Koshi uses the role from your configuration file (project-specific if available, otherwise the default).

### Create or Update Pull Request

```sh
koshi pr
```

This command lets you review or edit your commit description, pushes your commit to GitHub, and creates or updates a pull request. When opening or updating a PR, Koshi will prompt you to select reviewers interactively based on your configuration.

---

## Requirements

- [jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) (Jujutsu)
- [argc](https://github.com/sigoden/argc)
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- [aichat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat)
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) (GitHub CLI)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (for JSON parsing)

All must be available in your `$PATH`.

---

## Installation

1. Copy `koshi.sh` into a directory in your `$PATH` and make it executable:

   ```sh
   cp koshi.sh ~/bin/koshi
   chmod u+x ~/bin/koshi
   ```

2. Install all dependencies using your system package manager or from their respective repositories.

3. (Optional) Integrate `koshi` with `jj` by adding aliases in your `.jj/config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [aliases]
   ai-desc   = ['util', 'exec', '--', 'koshi', 'ai-desc']
   ai-commit = ['util', 'exec', '--', 'koshi', 'ai-desc', '--commit']
   ```

4. Create the configuration file at `~/.config/koshi/config.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration) for details).

---

## Configuration

Koshi uses a single configuration file at `~/.config/koshi/config.json` to manage both AI roles and reviewer suggestions. You can override this location with the `--config` option.

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "ai_description_role": "code-author",
  "project_settings": {
    "$HOME/projects/myproject": {
      "ai_description_role": "backend-engineer",
      "reviewers": ["alice", "bob"]
    },
    "$HOME/projects/frontend": {
      "ai_description_role": "frontend-developer",
      "reviewers": ["carol", "dave"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Fields

#### Global Settings

- **`ai_description_role`**: The default AI role to use when generating commit descriptions. This is used when no project-specific role is configured.

#### Project Settings

The `project_settings` object contains project-specific configurations, keyed by the full filesystem path to your repository (with `$HOME` as a variable).

For each project, you can configure:

- **`ai_description_role`**: Project-specific AI role that overrides the global default
- **`reviewers`**: Array of GitHub usernames to suggest as default reviewers for pull requests

### What is an AI Role?

An AI role is a configuration for `aichat` that defines the persona and behavior of the AI assistant when generating commit messages. Roles tell the AI:
- How to format commit messages (e.g., title length, body formatting)
- What tone and perspective to use (e.g., "engineer sending code for review")
- What information to include or exclude
- Special rules or patterns to follow

Roles are defined in your `aichat` configuration. See the [aichat Role Guide](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat/wiki/Role-Guide) for instructions on how to configure roles.

The [`role.md`](role.md) file in this repository shows an example of a well-structured role definition that:
- Formats commits with a 50-character title line
- Includes ticket references when provided
- Marks work-in-progress with "WIP:" prefix
- Keeps descriptions proportional to code changes

### AI Role Resolution

When determining which AI role to use, Koshi follows this precedence:

1. Command-line `--role` argument (highest priority)
2. Project-specific `ai_description_role` from `project_settings`
3. Global `ai_description_role`
4. Exit with an error if no role is configured

The AI role is passed to `aichat` and should match a role you've configured there.

### Reviewer Suggestions

When creating or updating a pull request, Koshi will:

1. Look for reviewers configured for the current project in `project_settings`
2. Merge these with any existing reviewers on the pull request
3. Present the combined set for interactive selection

## Example Workflow

```sh
# Configure project-specific settings
$ cat > ~/.config/koshi/config.json << EOF
{
  "ai_description_role": "code-author",
  "project_settings": {
    "$HOME/projects/backend": {
      "ai_description_role": "backend-engineer",
      "reviewers": ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Work on a feature
$ cd ~/projects/backend
$ jj new
# ...make code changes...

# Generate AI commit message (uses "backend-engineer" role automatically)
$ koshi ai-desc --ticket ABC-123 --commit --pull_request
```

Koshi will:
1. Show the diff
2. Use the "backend-engineer" AI role to propose a commit message
3. Let you refine it interactively
4. Commit the changes
5. Create a PR with `alice`, `bob`, and `charlie` as suggested reviewers
